## Common Starting Point for Recipes

The starting point for reagent-cookbook recipes is [reagent-cookbook-template](https://github.com/gadfly361/reagent-cookbook-template).

```
$ lein new rc <name of recipe>
```

Note: reagent-cookbook-template was made specifically for following along with recipes - it is not meant for production.  If you are interested in starting a new reagent application, then [reagent-template](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template) provides a good starting configuration: `$ lein new reagent <name of app>`.
